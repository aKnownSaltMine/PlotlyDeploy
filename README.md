## Overview
The point of this project is to present the biodiversity of the bellybuttons of a multitude of test subjects in order to seek out the conditions that a particular strain arises from for the purposes of identifying a strain that would be able to produce synthetic beef flavor.

## Results
In order to achieve this goal, we created a dashboard that filters based on the volunteer test subject ID number in order to display the top ten strains of bacteria located, and their count. As well as a bubble graph that shows the cultures per sample found. Topping it off there is a guage that shows the grooming and cleaning habits of the individual volunteer.
